      <p>Welcome to Symbiota! This game is a simulation of the human gut microbiome, which is 
        the community of the trillions of microbiota (bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses) 
        living throughout the body. The microbiome is considered a supporting organ because it 
        plays so many key roles in the body, from strengthening your immune system to helping 
        you obtain nutrients from food. The balance and types of bacteria in your microbiome 
        are directly influenced by your food choices. Your goal is to achieve a state of 
        symbiosis: the peaceful coexistence of all types of microbiota within the microbiome.</p>

      <!-- <p>This game simulates three of the most common bacteria found in the microbiome: 
        Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium difficile. While Bifidobacteria and 
        Lactobacillus are good bacteria which perform many essential functions, Clostridium 
        difficile is an example of a type of bacteria which could be harmful if it overgrows. 
        In this game, Clostridium difficile will spawn periodically, indicated by the "Next 
        Wave" bar. The number of Clostridium difficile that spawn is proportional to the number
        of good bacteria on screen. Make sure to click on the buttons at the top to find out 
        more about each bacteria, and what foods help them reproduce.</p>

      <p>Each bacteria has a health level, indicated by the bar floating below it. 
        The good bacteria, Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus, and the bad bacteria, Clostridium 
        difficile, attack each other while there are 3 or more Clostridium difficile, during which 
        the microbiome is in a state of dysbiosis (imbalance). If a bacteria's health bar drops 
        to zero, it will die.</p>

      <p>The good bacteria will release coins periodically which can be used to buy food. Hover 
        your mouse over coins to collect them. To buy a food, just drag it into the microbiome 
        in the center. Each food will add a certain bacteria, based on the nutrients it contains. 
        After you buy a food, you will not be able to buy it again for a short time, indicated by 
        a countdown over the food image. You have to buy the right combination of foods to 
        cultivate the goal numbers of bacteria.</p>

      <p>If you get the counts of each bacteria to match the goal counts, you win. 
        If all of your good bacteria die, you lose.</p> -->

      <p>Controls:
        <ul>
          <li>Click on the bacteria labels at the top to read their bios.</li>
          <li>Drag the foods into the microbiome in the center to buy them.</li>
          <li>Hover over coins to collect them.</li>
          <li>Click on the mute button or press "M" key to toggle mute.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Have fun!</p>
